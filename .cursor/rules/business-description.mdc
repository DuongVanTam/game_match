# Business Description

## Overview
A web platform organizing **Teamfight Tactics (TFT)** skill-based tournaments.
Players pay a **small entry fee** to join matches and compete for rewards.

## Core Principles
1. **Skill-Based, Not Gambling**
   - Results depend on gameplay performance, not luck.
   - Rewards = “refund of service fee + bonus” to winners.

2. **“Tạm ứng dịch vụ” model**
   - Players pay a **temporary service advance** (not a deposit).
   - Fees fund platform operation & prize distribution.

3. **Virtual Ledger System**
   - Real money only exists in your Momo/PayOS account.
   - App tracks “virtual balance” in database.
   - Users can request withdrawal = “refund of unused advance”.

## Revenue Model
- **Service Fee:** 10–20% per match from total entry fees.
- **Additional:** potential ads, sponsorships, premium tournaments.

## Payment Flow (MVP)
1. User sends money via **Momo/PayOS** → goes to your personal account.
2. Backend confirms → increases user’s **virtual balance**.
3. User joins a match → balance deducted.
4. After match:
   - Winner gets virtual reward.
   - Platform keeps service fee.
5. User requests withdrawal → you transfer money manually.

## Legal Alignment
- Defines all transactions as **“service fees”** or **“temporary advances”**.
- No “wallet” or “betting” terminology used.
- Matches are **skill competitions**, not chance-based.
- Refund policy: unused balance auto-refunded after defined period.

## Future Scale Plan
- Phase 2: PayOS API for automatic webhook confirmation & payout.
- Phase 3: Register business (mã ngành 6312/6209).
- Phase 4: Seek sponsors, run branded tournaments.
